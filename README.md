# MY JAVASCRIPT NOTES FROM "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!".

I made this repo by following "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!" course from Udemy.

[Course-Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

You can find the lecture codes and challenge answers. Every section foldered and named more clearly (at least for myself) by myself.
