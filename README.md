# MY JAVASCRIPT NOTES FROM "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!".
I made this repo by following "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!" course from Udemy.

You can find the lecture codes and challenge answers. Every section foldered and named more clearly (at least for myself) by myself.
