'use strict';


let hasDriversLicense = false;
const passTest = true;

if (passTest) hasDriverLicense = true;

//this one is new variable because of spelling mistake. If you didn't use strict mode you cannot see error.
//But strict mode gives you an error for this type of things.
//You should change hasDriverLicense to hasDriversLicense than code from bellow will work

if (hasDriversLicense) console.log('You can drive car!');

// const interface = 'Audio';//this names are reserved for future use so gives you an error
// const private = 543;//You cannot use private bc js does
